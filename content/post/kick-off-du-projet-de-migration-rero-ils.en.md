The kick-off session of the RERO ILS migration project took place on December 3rd in the presence (virtually, of course) of representatives of the 41 libraries that are part of the adventure. It was notably the occasion to recall the context of the project, to detail the outlines of version 1.0.0, to explain the development mode from 2021, and of course to present the migration schedule.
